Terminology and Best Practices

  - In Lutron RA2 Inclusive software, the terminology is based on where
    'Lutron devices' (switches, dimmers, keypads) are "ganged" and how
    faceplates are ordered and (optionally) labeled.
        Zone Location - The installation room for a Lutron Device
      Device Location - The name of a ganged collection of Lutron Devices
            Zone Name - The circuit the Lutron Device controls
  - Unlike Lutron, Hubitat rooms typically denote a group of circuits, a
    functional grouping of devices rather than a physical grouping of devices.
  - For improved clarity, Lutron "Zone Names" (effectively device labels),
    include the circuit's room (Den, Kitchen, ...) as a prefix.
      Example:
        Lutron Room / Zone Location - Den              // Installation Room
             Lutron Device Location - Kitchen Slider   // Ganged Box Location
                  Hubitat Room Name - Lanai            // Circuit's Room
                          Zone Name - Lanai Pendants   // Circuit's Name
