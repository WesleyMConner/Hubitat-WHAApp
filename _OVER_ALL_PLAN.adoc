= OVER ALL PLAN

== Extract Lutron Data
=== Future Capability
* Shred raw Lutron RA2 and Caseta integration reports (delivered via a Hubitat Settings?) into ready-to-use Hubitat State maps.
* Table-like Data

| Device Room	| Device Location | Device name |	Model	| ID	| Component	 Component Number	| Name

| Room | Id

| Zone Room	| Zone Name	| ID					

| etc...

=== Tactically
* Write goal maps into State manually.

=== RA2
** RA2 repeater's hubId -> [Room, Scene, on/off]
** activate Room & Scene -> RA2 repeater button press

=== CasÃ©ta
** Pro2 repeater's hubId -> [Room, Scene, on]
** Pro2 repeater
